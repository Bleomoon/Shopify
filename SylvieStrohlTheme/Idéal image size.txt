Although all our themes are created to accommodate images of any size, the optimum dimensions we would recommend are as follows 
(for additional reference, these dimensions are in use on our very own demo sites):

Image with Text Overlay - 2000 x 1350px
Slideshow - 2600 x 1000px for larger screens / 2000 x 900px for more popular laptop and desktop sizes 
(Please note - Full Height will vary, based on the viewers' screensize in question) 
Products: 2000 x 2000px for a square image, 2000 x 1800px for landscape images and 1600 x 2000 for portrait images.
Collection - 2000 x 175px for a banner image at the top of the page, 480 x 320px for a feature image.
Adverts are dependent on how many are used; 1000 x 650px is great as a ballpark number for two or more. One stand-alone Advert could be 1700 x 350px.
Blog posts - 1000 x 350px
Hero - 1200 x 900px
